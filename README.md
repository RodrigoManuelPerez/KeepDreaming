**Keep Dreaming**

This repo is to store the project of Keep Dreaming, a unity game made in 40h for the Wholesome GameJam of Wholesome Games.

All the code (aside from Unity&#39;s) for this project was written by me within the 40h and most of the integration of any other asset, as well as the post-processing effects.

**Don&#39;t give Up!**

Keep dreaming is a game where the goal is to keep your room quiet and comfy while dreaming to lo-fi music. As you don&#39;t want to cut your dreams this morning, you&#39;ll have to postpone the alarm clock, keep the room dark, turn off every device, open or close the window to control temperature and... yes, pet the dog.
